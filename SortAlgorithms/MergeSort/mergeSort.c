/*
Merge Sort Algorithm (Divide and conquer algorithm)

Merge Sort iis an effective sorting algorithm that produces a stable sort, 
which means that if two elements have the same value, they hold the same 
relative position in the sorted sequence as they did in the input.
In other words, thte relative order of elements with equal values is preserved.
